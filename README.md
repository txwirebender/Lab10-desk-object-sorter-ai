## Project Description
This project consisted of teaching an AI model to recognize images. A total of 5 differetn objects were chosen that varied from what I considered "well-known" to possibly unknow with respect to familiarity. The expectation, i.e., hypothesis, was that the more familiar objects wold have a higher recognition score than the unfamiliar ones.
