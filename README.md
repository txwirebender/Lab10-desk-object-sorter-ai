## Project Description
This project consisted of teaching an AI model to recognize images. A total of 5 differetn objects were chosen that varied from what I considered "well-known" to possibly unknow with respect to familiarity. The expectation, i.e., hypothesis, was that the more familiar objects wold have a higher recognition score than the unfamiliar ones.

## Classes Identified
Class 1 - Pen/Pencil Holder
Class 2 - Blue Screen Glasses
Class 3 - Stapler
Class 4 - Letter Opener
Class 5 - Green Highlighter

## Discussion and Reflection
1. Model Performance & Iteration
   a) Suprisingly the accuaracy was more than expected and the variation between objects was minimal with the excetion of the letter opener.       My expectation was met with having the lowest accuarcy, but surprised at how it was.
   b) To improve the accuracy of the letter opener I did more training with closer view, and a simple/basic background.
   c) The enhanced training of the ltter opener significantly improved the model's accurayc and confidnece to 100% from a variation range of       60-80 percentiles.
